Extraction of structured data from unstructered lab reports
Contains 4 experiments where I have tried different methods and tools to extract as much of the desired information as possible. The ideal format is to find all parameters such as testosterone, clucose, and so on, and return them in a format like this: {parameter:'testosterone', value:'4', unit:'mmol/L'}
